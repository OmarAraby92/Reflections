When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  -If several people are working on the same project
  -If I choose to work on the same project from several computers
  -If I'm afraid of losing my work in case any accident would happen to my PC
  -If I want to share my work with the world

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  -Perhaps I'm not interested in adding changes committed by a certain developer working on the project
  -Maybe I'm working on a certain branch that pulling the changes might mess up my work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  -Branches: a way to make changes in a repository without messing up the project.
  -Clones: exact copies of a repository
  -Forks: like clones but from a github repo to another github repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  - minimzes merge conflicts
  - allows me to know when to pull the changes

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  - without github I'll need to send copies of the project via e-mail every time I make a change:
  	-it'll be easier because I won't have to learn how to use github
  	-much more difficult adn complicated because I wont be able to merge my work with the collaboator woks safely and in an organized fashion
