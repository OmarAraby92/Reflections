What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

-Pros: we'd have few meaningful commits. and the commits would be a full code not saved in the middle of writing
-cons: people forget to save.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-because in git one action can cause change in multiple files. for example adding a button could change the java and css and html files alltogether.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

-by using git logI can get the ID or SHA of the wanted file.
_then by using git diff I can compare 2 files using $ git diff firstSHA secondSHA


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-because if something breaks I could just go back to an older version where the bug had not been introduced yet and keep working from there.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-I want to use it to save versions of my code so that I can take risks experimenting with my program
